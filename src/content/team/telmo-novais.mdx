Telmo, Born in Guimarães in 1997, and have been living in Porto for 4 years. My
academic journey led me to explore Sports Sciences. Moreover, cycling has been a
constant in my life as long as I can remember, and biking through the city has
allowed me to discover new places in a unique way. This connection with physical
activity and exploration has led me to reflect on the richness of experiences
that the world offers. However, my true passion lies in people's stories. I love
socializing and uncovering the unique narratives that each individual carries.
This inherent curiosity about people's lives aligns perfectly with TBT's
mission, where the diversity of cultures and stories is celebrated.
