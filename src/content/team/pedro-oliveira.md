Born in 1962, Pedro used to work on the banking business. "I dedicate myself now
to my old passion : cycling". Pedro started working at the age of 14 in the
Portuguese banking market and during this time he studied at night. Being an
enthusiastic adept of sport, he has since a very young age played handball,
football, karate and windsurf. But it was in cycling that he found is identity.
"This is a sport in which we impose our limit in each cycling route and at the
same time it gives us a sense of adrenaline and exceptional freedom."
Occasionally he participates in competitions in order to develop physical form,
but not seeking exceptional results. From these we can highlight the 600km of
Brazil Ride, 24h MTB Lordelo , the NGPS stages in the north of the Portugal and
the XCO championship from Vila do Conde. Crossing the land with his mountain
bike, he already cycled the pilgrimage routes to Santiago from Porto and from
France, the paths to FÃ¡tima and the Great Route of 22 Historic villages of
Portugal. Pedro occasionally participates in guided bike tours, when he is
available.
