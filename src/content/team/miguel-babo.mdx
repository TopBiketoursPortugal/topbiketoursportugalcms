I'm Miguel, a dedicated tour guide born in the picturesque town of Amarante
in 1994. With a degree in tourism from Universidade de Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto
Douro, I've been passionately immersed in the world of guided tours,
specializing in cycling adventures that showcase the beauty of our country. My
roots in Amarante run deep, providing me with a profound understanding of
portuguese cultural tapestry and hidden gems. As your guide, I'm not just here
to lead; I'm here to share the stories, local insights, and scenic wonders that
make Portugal truly special. What sets my cycling tours apart is my personal
connection to the sport. For over five years, I've embraced the thrill of
downhill cycling, fostering a profound love for the open road and the adventures
it unfolds. This firsthand experience fuels my commitment to creating cycling
holidays that not only explore our stunning landscapes but also capture the
spirit of two-wheeled exploration.
