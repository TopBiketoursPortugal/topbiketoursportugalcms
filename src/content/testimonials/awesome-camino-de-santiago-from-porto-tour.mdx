title: Awesome Camino de Santiago from Porto Tour
quote:
  We did the bike tour to Camino de Santiago from Porto. Sergio and the entire
  Top Bike Tours have been nothing short than amazing. They are so responsible
  and prepared, they have lots of knowledge about the path and surroundings,
  they were prepared with tools, water, snacks, tools and spares to make the
  trip as smooth as possible. They booked us at the most amazing hotels making
  the experience even better, people on other tours saw the hotels we stayed at
  and felt their experience was so underwhelming compared to ours. I had done
  other bike tours and this was so much better than previous ones. I truly
  recommend this company.
