  This was such a highlight of our 3 1/2 weeks in Portugal. Can’t say enough
  good things about this ride! The views and the diversity of scenery were
  amazing. We did this with e-bikes as there is a lot of climbing in this trip.
  Sergio and his team were wonderful. We went to his shop beforehand to get fit
  for the bike and given all the details of the ride. The GPS route was
  extremely easy to follow and the accommodations were very good. The location
  of the accommodations were so unique and tucked into places with amazing
  views. It more than met my expectations! I’ve been on several self guided bike
  trips and this one ranks up there with the best! Don’t hesitate to book with
  Sergio.
