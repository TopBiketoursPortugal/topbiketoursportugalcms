  A BRILLIANT lifetime memory biking with TBT from Porto to Santiago de
  Compostela, via the Camino
quote:
  A BRILLIANT Lifetime memory provided by Top Bike Tours Portugal! We biked over
  a week from Porto to Santiago de Compostela! Sergio and the team took great
  care of us from the moment we arrived. The journey, the path, "the Camino",
  the way of the Saints from Porto is soo wonderful, along the Atlantic Coast
  with provincial village scenes mixed with pastoral meadows, beaches, pastures
  with grazing animals. While TBT Portugal didn't create all of that scenery,
  they made our trip so easy and pleasurable with our stays in fantastic hotels
  ( 2 castles!), and bringing us to the city centers to enjoy lunch and breaks.
  TBT Portugal does a GREAT Job!
