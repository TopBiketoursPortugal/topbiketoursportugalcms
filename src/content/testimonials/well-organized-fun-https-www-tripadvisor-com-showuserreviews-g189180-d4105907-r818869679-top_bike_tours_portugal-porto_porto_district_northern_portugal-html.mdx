title: Well-organized & fun!
quote:
  I did a two-night, self-guided tour of the Douro Valley with an e-bike. Very
  well planned and organized. Luxury accommodations. The GPS and printed maps
  were easy to follow, plus I downloaded an app with the planned routes. Very
  professional service that made my trip easy and fun! Highly recommended!
