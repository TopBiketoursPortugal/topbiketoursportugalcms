quote:
  If you’ve ever contemplated a bike tour this is the trip for you. Sergio and
  Henrique provided a fabulous experience. The pace each day was great, the
  accommodations were top notch and the food each evening made this the perfect
  active vacation. We saw beautiful scenery, quaint little villages, miles and
  miles of beaches. One high light was watching the sardine fishermen being in
  their catch one evening.
