title: Incredibly well organized and fun.
quote:
  Porto to Santiago El Camino, seaside bicycle tour, while challenging at times,
  even on an ebike, the route was incredible, and the food and accommodations
  were amazing. Sergio and his crew (JoJo we called him) and Pedro) were a joy
  to be with, and full of fun and knowledge.
