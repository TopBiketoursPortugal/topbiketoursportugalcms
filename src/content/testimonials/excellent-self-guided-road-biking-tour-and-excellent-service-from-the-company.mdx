  '**Excellent self guided road biking tour and excellent service from the
  company**'
quote:
  Sergio was very responsive and efficient in the booking. I enquired about the
  self guided Tras-os-Montes and douro international tour on 5 May and got a
  departure on 25 May with even a modification to the standard tour to fit our
  request for an additional cycling day along the Douro to our first hotel.
  Excellent quality race bikes provided with plenty of material (lights, tube,
  gps device, etc). Routes are spectacular and with few or no traffic. Hotel
  choices vary from very good to medium. Guide of restaurants to visit
  "en-route" or at the destination of the day needs updating as we experienced
  closed restaurants or very bad quality eating. Overall excellent trip and
  service!
