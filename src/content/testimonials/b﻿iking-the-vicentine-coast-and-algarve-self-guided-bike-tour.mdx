  We just finished an amazing week of cycling along the coast from Lisbon to
  Lagos. Top bike did a great job lining up our bikes, hotels, routes and
  numerous recommendations. We loved going through all the small towns and all
  of the dirt roads and trails, so that we really saw the Portugal countryside,
  cliffs and all this beautiful country has to offer!
