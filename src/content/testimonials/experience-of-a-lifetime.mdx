title: Experience of a Lifetime!
quote:
  We rode from Porto to Santiago de Compostela May 18 - 24, 2022. We added an
  extra day in Santiago to explore the Cathedral and get our Camino
  certificates. The route was scenic and well chosen. The Garmin gps provided
  and well as the downloaded route in the "RidewithGPS" app made our independent
  navigation effortless. The accommodations provided as well as the baggage
  service were excellent. Riders should be aware that the first 3 days are
  relatively flat but the last 3 from Baiona to Santiago de Compostela contain
  some tough climbs that will require walking (or pushing) your bike unless you
  are a very strong rider. Consider an e-bike option if you are a casual rider.
