  # Portuguese Coastal route to Santiago de Compostela: Stage 1


  ## **Follow the Atlantic breeze towards Santiago**


  Walk towards Santiago using the Portuguese coastal path. Cross sunny and
  seaside areas such as Póvoa, Esposende, Vila Praia de Âncora, Caminha and
  Baiona.

  Be in mind this is the original route to Santiago de Compostela “near” the
  Coast. It is possible to adapt the hiking route for a easier terrain. A big
  part of the pilgrims already walk near the sea, avowing some mountains and
  forest.

  You may also consider our [Easy route North of Atlantic
  Coast](http://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/hiking-atlantic-coast-porto).

  This hike is divided in two different stages. Stage 1 which goes through
  Portuguese territory and [stage
  2](http://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/hiking-coast-santiago-compostela-stage-2)
  which takes you through Spain to Santiago de Compostela. For a complete
  experience you might think to book the 2 stages,

  - title: 'Day 2: Transfer to Praia da memória – Póvoa: 20 km'
    description: >-
      Starting at the monument in Praia da memória, which represents the landing
      place of the troops that defended the city of Porto, during its long siege
      in the first half of the XIX century, a 20km walk awaits. This day’s walk
      is integrally flat with minor and imperceptible short climbs, to which
      contributes the low coast level of this area. It ends in Póvoa de Varzim,
      a city known to be historically connected to the sea.

      Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day are: the
      fish market at Angeiras, the almost imperceptible triangulation station of
      São Paio, the small and protected landscape of Vila do Conde Coast and
      Mindelo Ornithological reserve which you will pass through during your
      walk, Santa Clara’s Monastery in Vila do Conde, a replica of a Portuguese
      vessel called Nau in Vila do Conde and the fortress of Nossa Senhora da
      Conceição in Póvoa de Varzim, right at the end of this day’s walk.

  - title: 'Day 3: Póvoa – Esposende: 22 km'
    description: >-
      Another flat day. It goes from Póvoa de Varzim to Esposende. Today, half
      of the day will be nearby the North Coast Natural Park, which goes from
      south of Apúlia to the river mouth of the river Neiva. This walk portraits
      an urbanized coastal area, with a decent amount of cobblestone roads in
      the company of farmed land and path walks near the beach. Some of the
      areas that might spark your interest during the day are: Masseira
      agriculture fields, which is a unique form of agriculture practiced in the
      dunes around this area and the fort of São João Baptista in Esposende.

    description: >-
      Leaving Esposende in order to get to Viana do Castelo, you will find a
      route with several ups and downs until your final destination. Prepare to
      admire the surroundings with a lot of natural landscape. Halfway you might
      notice the chapel of Senhora do Castro. In the same area there is a
      sightseeing viewpoint that captures the beautiful mountainous landscape.
      While in Viana do Castelo you can visit the Cathedral and the Santa Lúzia
      Sanctuary.

  - title: 'Day 5: Viana do Castelo – Vila Praia de Âncora: 19 km'
    description: >-
      Departing from Viana do Castelo this is the shortest walk so far. Almost
      nineteen kilometers separate Viana and Vila Praia de Âncora. The walk
      itself is flat done mainly on dirt paths and cobblestone roads. It conveys
      a naturalistic feeling, being most of the walk done in a not so urbanized
      coast, like in the previous one. Some of the areas that might spark your
      interest during the day are: The several forts and windmills you will find
      along the way, the lighthouse of Montedor and the Dolmen of Barrosa in
      Vila Praia de Âncora.

    description: >-
      Continuing along the coast and keeping the same type of low land terrain,
      the walk today gets to the heart of the river that divides Portugal and
      Spain in their northernmost frontier. This is an easy walk, short in
      distance and elevation. Spain can already be seen in the previous walk,
      however today, it is clearly visible in a mountain which looks most like a
      volcano. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day
      are: The chapel of Santo Isidoro, the wayside cross of Santo Isidoro,
      Camarido woods by which you will pass near the end of this walk, the
      chapel of N. S. das Areias and the village of Caminha one and a half
      kilometers away from the hotel.

    description: >-
      The beginning of this walk leads to a fisherman boat, which will take it
      to leave Portugal and enter Spain. While being slightly less flat, the
      path follows the same tendency as the previous one, being majorly plane,
      with its highest point at 60m and lowest at 0m. This walk follows part of
      the road that connects Tui and Vigo through the coast, however touching it
      only occasionally when no alternative path exists. This road has a big
      shoulder in the form of a path for bicycles and pedestrians, which makes
      it safe. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day
      are: Sea Museum in Guarda, the several sightseeing points along the way
      and the monastery and town of Oia.

    day: '7'
  - title: 'Day 8: Oia – Baiona: 18 km'
    description: >-
      Walking between Oia and Baiona feels like the previous walk. The same road
      is followed and in the same terms, although a big portion of the walk is
      done on the main road. The same protective shoulder exists every time the
      path stays on this road. A considerable portion of the path is asphalted
      road. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day are:
      The several sightseeing points along the way, the lighthouse of Cabo
      Silleiro, the old lighthouse of Cabo Sileiro, the coastal artillery of
      Cabo Silleiro, the statue of virxe da rocha, the castle of Monterreal,
      which is the location of the hotel and the museum of the Carabela La
      Pinta.
