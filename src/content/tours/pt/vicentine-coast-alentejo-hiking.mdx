      Start this journey in the city of Aljezur, a place that goes back to
      prehistoric times and was founded by the Arabs in the 10th century. The
      most famous historical site in Aljezur is its Castle. The castle was used
      by the Romans and the Arabs, and was latter on conquered by the Portuguese
      in the 12th century. This castle is one of those depicted in the middle of
      the Portuguese flag.

      are a fan of bird watching, this area is for you to discover. Enjoy the
      rest of your day in Pedralva in the peace and privacy in that which is a

      This walk might be the hardest one so far with quite a few ups and downs

      arrival into Sagres take a shortcut to Cabo de São Vicente to its Fort.
      This fort is consider one of the most important forts in Algarve, mainly
      because in the past it was a crossing zone between the Atlantic ocean and
      the Mediterranean sea.
