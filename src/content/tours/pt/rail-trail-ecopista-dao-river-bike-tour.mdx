# **Rail trail - Ecopista Dão river bike tour**

## Have a break of 1 day or cycle the area in 2 days

In 2011 a railroad called Ecopista do Dão between Viseu, in the center of
Portugal, and Santa Comba Dão, was opened as a bike and walking route. This
route as 49 km and it is a very easy route. The landscape is very beautiful,
with mountains views and valleys covered with cork, cork oaks and chestnut
trees. Small villages and some vineyards are also part of this route. Some other
highlights of this area are the river beach and the chance to visit Tondela city

Note that this route can be very monotonous if you are an experience cyclist. If
you ever cycle an old rail trail transformed in a cycling path you can know what
to expect. This is a very good route for families with children, for people that
is starting to cycle or just to know more about the region.

It is optional to add 1 more day route to your package. This route of 46 km goes
from Nelas do Santa Comba Dão, and it is a moderate route, where it is possible
to cycle near the river in dirt roads with some loose stones. It is possible to
adapt the route to cycle in the road where the traffic is few. Some of the areas
that might spark your interest during the day are the Nelas city, the
Prehistoric Circuit where is possible to explore the Dolmens, Orcs and Menhir ,
and the Mondego river.
