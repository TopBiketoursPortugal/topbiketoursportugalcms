  A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
  mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the
  charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like
  mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of
  mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.

      The cycling trip starts in Melgaço, a city in the north of Portugal, on
      the banks of the Minho River. It is a small, beautiful and historical
      town, overseen by the tower of Homage, located high up in the old medieval
      area. It overviews the beautiful Minho valley, filled with vineyards that
      surround Melgaço and the nearby Peneda Geres park. Today you will also be
      meeting our local partner, including a tour presentation and explanation.

    description: >-
      Melgaço is alongside the Minho River. Famous for its beautiful landscape,
      history, gastronomy and also for producing the well-known and much
      appreciated green wine caste, “Alvarinho”.Every year this city organizes
      the “Festa do Alvarinho e do Fumeiro”, a huge event which is nationally
      and internationally known. This event showcases the local gastronomy (like
      the Alvarinho green wine) and many other local handmade crafts. Advancing
      to Monção, where the valleys are conducive to the practice of agriculture
      and viticulture, it is possible to find several archaeological finds that
      testify to a past filled with traces of the passage of different
      communities through these lands. The city of Valença is a historical town
      in the north of Portugal. It is located right on the border with Spain,
      separated by the beautiful Minho River, and surrounded by ramparts atop a
      hill, boasting a long defensive look. Hotel 4 *: [Pousada de Valença

    description: >-
      Leaving Valença, continue along with the Minho river. One of today's
      destination is Caminha, a fortified town where several battles were fought
      between Portugal and Spain. Standing on a tiny island in the middle of the
      estuary are the ruins of the fort of Ínsua, built as a defensive measure
      concerning the entrance in the river during the XVth century. Nowadays
      there is a daily ferry-boat linking the two banks of the river between the
      countries. This city is also very well-known for its natural and green
      heritage: the sightseeing areas, waterfalls, beaches, camping parks and
      the “Modelo” beach (a favorite destination of famous people in Portugal).
      The midday stop is Vila Nova de Cerveira, the 'Village of the Arts'. The
      city became, after 1978, the meeting point of artists from all over the
      world. Cycle alongside the coast, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, and
      you’ll reach Viana do Castelo. The city is one of the most beautiful
      seaside cities of the north of Portugal. Viana held a huge importance to
      Portugal in the Age of the Portuguese Discoveries and later on with the
      cod fish fishing. This city has a huge tradition and connection with the
      sea, with the fisherman proudly showcasing it nowadays, mainly during the
      great festivity of “Nossa Senhora da Agonia”. It was also here that the
      ships were built and later deployed to Brazil, India, Africa and other
      Portuguese colonies, during the XVth and XVIth centuries. Hotel 4 *: [Melo

      Leaving Viana, the cycling will be back to the interior of Portugal, with
      the beautiful Lima River alongside. The destination is now Ponte de Lima,
      a city recognized as world heritage and stands as the ultimate North of
      Portugal in all its rusticity and scenic beauty. This land is full of
      history and is located in the former Braga-Tui military road. It is the
      oldest Portuguese village, since 1125 when it was granted charter. Its
      bridge, over the river Lima, built by the Romans in the 1st century, has
      always been a place of passage for the pilgrims who were going to
      Santiago. Ponte de Lima is the cradle of Housing Tourism, of the
      “Loureiro” variety that distinguishes the “Vinho Verde” and the Rice of
      “Sarrabulho” appreciated in the most faraway places in the world. Hotel 4

      Today is a day to get to know the south bank of the river Lima for about
      25 km. Then we will begin our journey heading to Esposende, a seaside city
      located in the North. During this day, you will be overwhelmed with
      seaside landscapes and small “Portuguese rivieras” until you reach
      Esposende, a city from the Middle Ages. Neiva river and its clear waters,
      green pine forest of Ofir and the stunning views that offer different
      viewpoints of Esposende, are just some of the interesting features of the
      county in which the richness of the natural landscape and heritage built
      by human hand, as is the case of windmills, fields in the trough, the
      forts and mills, are combined in a unique harmony, forming landscapes of
      high scenic and environmental value and confirms Esposende as one of the
      most beautiful counties in the North region. Hotel 3 *: [Suave Mar

      you can experience ancient traditions linked to the fish exploration as
      well as tasting this famous gastronomy. In Vila do Conde, you’ll know why
