  # **Historical Alentejo: rural trails**


  ## **A hike to relax surrounded by cork trees and pastures**


  Pure and simple. That is a simple way to describe Alentejo. The region seems
  to have remained a bit outside our time and it refused entering on our chaotic
  and frenetic way of living. A necessary relaxation and slow down of our
  natural present posture are necessary, to fully take in what this region
  offers. Alentejo does have one of the best Human Development Index values in
  the country, which might portrait how good it can be for us a little time off
  in the region.


  **IMPORTANTE NOTE:** From June to September this is not a recommended tour due
  the heat. If you know what to expect from a 35º degree walking tour you may
  consider to book it.

      Today’s walk is a little about megalithic times. In a few miles you will
      face with the biggest Menhir in the entire Iberian Peninsula. The route
      today serves the purpose of discovering megalithic sites, especially when
      you enter in the Coureleiros Megalithic Park.

    description: >-
      The area of Alentejo is known to be that of a region in harmony with
      nature, where humans explore for millennia what the land offers in what it
      is commonly known as Montado Alentejano. It is immediately noticeable the
      not so urbanized landscape, in a mixture of nature and agriculture
      exploration. There are two main hills to cross on this day’s walk, which
      will lead to Marvão. This little town is located on top of hill, which
      makes this walk peak at 820m, while starting at 520m. There is a mixture
      of all types of terrain. Some of the areas that might spark your interest
      during the day are: The medieval castle of Castelo de Vide, the synagogue
      of Castelo de Vide, Santa Maria da Devesa’s Mother Church, Marvão’s castle
      and the convent of Nossa Senhora da Estrela.

  - title: 'Day 4: Marvão – Ribeira de Nisa: 14 km'
    description: >-
      Being this walk extensively more downhill, since it has to get from
      Marvão, at the top of a hill, down to Ribeira de Nisa, it allows for a
      good view point across the entire region. It mainly crosses farmed land.
      All types of terrain are to be expected, however the majority of it will
      be on asphalt roads. If with enough time, there is an old roman city on
      the waiting to be visited, called Ammaia, which is likely from the 1st
      century BC. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the
      day are: The wonderful view of Marvão at Portagem, its roman bridge and
      Ammaia, an ancient roman city further down the day.

      The common and widely known cork trees from Alentejo are easily spotted
      during this day. Look for a sponge like tree bark, usually cut up to the
      upper half of it. The walk today is going to be mainly in paved roads with
      very low traffic. Take a walk around Fortios to see how the people live in
      rural areas.

      Most of the path is made in unpaved roads. 3 km after your walk Crato
      village will be found.The name of the town, Crato, comes from the title
      that was concede to the chef of the Order of the Knights of St. John of
      Jerusalem in Portugal, commonly known in Portuguese as Ordem do Hospital
      There is a small old dolmen called Anta de Crato which requires a two
      kilometer deviation from the course in order to visit. Some of the areas

      day, the Crato’s castle and the museum house of Padre Belo.  The dolmen of

      Similarly to the previous day, this walk will be relatively flat, using
      mainly dirt paths in the middle of the Montado Alentejano. For the first
      quarter of the day it goes uphill towards Alter Pedroso, only to start
      progressively descending and ending at Cabeço de Vide. This town was stage
      for investigations from NASA, because according to this agency, this
      region has hydrogeological characteristics that are believed to be
      identical to those found in Mars in the past and possibly still in the
      present day. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the
      day are: Remainings of Alter Pedroso’s Castle, the river beach of Jardim
      das Termas de Sulfúrea, Cabeço de Vide’s Castle and pillory.

      Another practically flat day. The early uphill and following downhill are

      is in unpaved terrain in the middle of an area highly know for Olive tree
      farming. Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day
      are: Torre de Palma, the place of your overnight stay which in the past
