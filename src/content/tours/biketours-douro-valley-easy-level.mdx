      case you opt for cycling, you will leave Penedono and find yourself in the
      middle of traditional farmlands. The landscape is dominated by vineyards
      and chestnuts, so much so that "Sernancelhe" area is known has the
      chestnut county. You will understand how much chestnut the region actually
      produces on the road side scenery. With the river Távora by your side you
      can enjoy the wonderful geography, with mountains and valleys, which is a
      trademark image of this part of the country. If you have the time, take a
      visit to the XIIth century church.
