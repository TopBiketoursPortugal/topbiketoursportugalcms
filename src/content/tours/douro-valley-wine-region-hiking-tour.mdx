      It was very easy to find the starting point for this tour. Get off the
      Porto Metro stop at Trindade, cross the road and 2 minutes walk and your
      there at the bike shop. There was only my husband and I on the tour, so it
      was very personal, and it was like going for walk with a friend. I
      apologise if I have got the guide's name incorrect, I think was Tiago!!<br
      />Any way he was very interesting and told us lots of interesting details,
      that we would not have realised by walking round on our own. He explained
      shops of special interest to us, explaining the Portuguese traditions. His
      knowledge was excellent.<br /><br />Part way though the tour we stopped at
      a coffee shop, (this is an extra cost, which you pay your own bill). We
      had coffees and warm Pasteis de Natas with cinnamon. You cannot have
      enough of these warm pastries.<br />During the tour we were asked if we
      were ok walking, which we were, otherwise he would have offered us a rest
      stop earlier on than the coffee shop/toilet break.<br /><br />The tour
      lasted just over 3 hours, and ended down by the riverside. Which is an
      ideal spot to have lunch, or continue over the bridge and explore Vila
      Nova de Gaia.<br /><br />This was a very enjoyable morning, and time well
      spent in Porto. Good value for money
