# **Douro Valley full day**

## **Discover Douro Valley cycling routes & scenic vineyards**

The ride will start in Vila Real and follow an old rail trail, now an easy dirt
track, for a unique bike tour in Douro Valley Portugal. We also have a route
available for road bikes if that is the style of your group.

The views will be breathtaking - vineyards, farms and the famous Douro River in
the picture.

In a full day, it is possible to visit 1 Farm. The plan is to cycle in the
morning, have lunch, and visit some viewpoints and farms (lunch and tickets to
visit farms and wineries are not included in the price package)

To have a more relaxing time to explore the area 3 different options are offered
in 3 different packages.

- Routes available with 25 km, 50 km or 77 km
- The first 22 km are going in a descent way and the rest of the route can be in
