# Douro Valley Cycling camp Training

## Training, discovering, calming and fun!

Douro Valley is known because of its Wine and great landscapes.

It's still an unknown region for several cyclists. Regions like Mallorca are
known for their great cycling camps, because of the weather conditions.

Douro Valley from March to November is also good when it comes to weather. Come
and train with us. We will suprise you with our local accommodations that, in
the majority of the time, are farms. Try our local gastronomy. You might be
surprised on how many different activities there are to complement your stay"!

Keep in mind that traffic in Douro Valley is really, really, really low!

We have the best tarmac roads for you, in a region without the usual tourist
invasion, when you compare it with Mallorca. What are you waiting for?

We have different daily rides in the region depending on your skills.

Contact us so we can know your physical level and send you a proposal.
