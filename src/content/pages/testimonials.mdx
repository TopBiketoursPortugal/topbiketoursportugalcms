        Founded in 2013, Top Bike Tours Portugal, unipessoal, Lda referred to
        here in as "Top Walking Tours Portugal" is a company with experience in
        pedestrian and cycling tours in the city of Porto and long distance
        cycling routes to the north of the Iberian Peninsula and all around
        Portugal. Our activities are coordinated by tourism professionals, with
        a huge knowledge on heritage and sports.


        In the end of 2017 we have changed our previous name "Fold n' Visit" to
        "Top Bike tours Portugal".

        Since 2013 we have a big offer of different city tours in Porto.
        Nowadays our core business is the creation of cycling and walking
        holiday packages. The city tours' offer was reduced, as well as the bike
        renting business for longer distances. It is possible to follow our
        history in Tripadvisor reviews.
