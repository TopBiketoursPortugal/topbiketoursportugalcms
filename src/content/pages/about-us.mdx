        Founded in 2013, Top Bike tours Portugal is a company with experience in
        pedestrian and cycling tours in the city of Porto and long distance
        cycling routes to the north of the Iberian Peninsula and all around
        Portugal. Our activities are coordinated by tourism professionals, with
        a huge knowledge on heritage and sports.


        In the end of 2017 we have changed our previous name "Fold n' Visit" to
        "Top Bike tours Portugal".


        Since 2013 we have a big offer of different city tours in Porto.
        Nowadays our core business is the creation of cycling holiday packages.
        The city tours' offer was reduced, as well as the bike renting business
        for longer distances. It is possible to follow our history in customer
        reviews/[testimonials](/testimonials).

      ## **How was Top Bike tours Portugal Born?**


      All started from the owner’s experience as a cycling passionate, who
      decided to overcome all difficulties and make a cycling trip to Santiago
      de Compostela. It started as a simple shop only focused on bicycle rentals
      and maintenance. However, the owner’s objectives were much larger and
      undoubtedly related to tourism. And that way was Top Bike tours Portugal
      born, seeking to provide an adequate service to customer needs, showing
      the best that cycling has to offer without the stress of having to plan,
      and organize, everything, and thus providing the best possible experience,
      whose value is the key ingredient in the ultimate satisfaction of the
      customer.
