Love doesn't choose ages, sexes, genders or even seasons. Whether it's a
long-term relationship or one of those beautiful but short-lived summer affairs,
everyone is looking for original date ideas to help keep the flame of passion
burning.

If the hot weather isn't helping your creative streak and you'd like to surprise
your better half with an original summer date, take note of these five ideas
provided by [Top Walking Tours](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/).

Come and celebrate love in a creative way!

## **5 ideas for original summer dates**

### **1 – Walking Tours in Portugal**

Summer hikes are quite normal these days. When night falls and the temperature
drops, it's usual to see hundreds of people out walking, but there's nothing
like the walks we're going to tell you about, which combine breathtaking natural
landscapes, history, gastronomy and warm, hospitable people.

We're talking about [Walking & Hiking Tours Portuga](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/)l by Top Walking Tours.

Among the many routes you can take advantage of are the Douro Valley route,
which will allow you to visit and stay overnight in some of the region's most
iconic estates, the Portuguese Way of St. James route along the coast, which
combines the tranquil nature of Portugal's northern coast with the enchantment
of the various historical monuments along the way, and the Historical Alentejo
route, which will take you along trails full of monuments and invitations to
romantic picnics under the stars.

### **2 – Parachuting**

To take your love higher, how about trying a summer date that includes a
parachute jump?

It's radical and full of adrenaline, but parachuting with your partner will be a
unique experience to remember later... on video, as the various skycenters
around the country (Évora, Maia, Braga, etc.) film the entire duration of the
jump.

Prices vary between 30 and 3400 euros.

### **3 – Paragliding**

Parachute jumping will give your relationship an immediate adrenaline boost, but
if you want something in the air that lasts longer, a paragliding flight is
ideal.

As we mentioned, unlike a parachute jump, a paragliding flight gives you all the
time in the world to observe Portugal's landscapes and natural wonders.

### **4 – Take a bike ride**

You may be thinking that there's nothing original about bike tours for two, but
that's because you haven't heard of
[Top Bike Tours](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/)which, like walking tours,
take you through some of Portugal's most interesting and exclusive natural
landscapes.

From the Silver Coast to the Vicentine Coast, via the Douro, the Alentejo and
even the French Way of St. James, there's no shortage of adventures to be had as
a couple.

### **5 – Private boat trip**

After land and air, we end these five ideas for original summer dates with a
private boat trip on the Tagus estuary.

In addition to total privacy (if you're only traveling with two crew members), a
boat trip for two can also include catering with everything your loved one is
entitled to and a stunning sunset with the city of Lisbon as a backdrop.
