## **8 Benefits of Hiking**

Among physical and mental benefits, hiking will help you to:

### **1 - Reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems**

Between the ups and downs of the trails, your physical health will benefit on a
cardiovascular level, since hiking allows you to reduce the risk of stroke by up
to 30%, lower your cholesterol levels and prevent hypertension.

What's more, walking will increase your heart rate, resulting in better blood
flow and oxygenation which, consequently, will translate into a marked
improvement in your cardiorespiratory capacity.

### **2 - Improving your mental health**

One of the great benefits of[walking](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/) is
undoubtedly the boost to your good mood thanks to the endorphins released, which
provide the neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of pleasure and
motivation.

Socializing with fellow hikers, facing new challenges and being able to learn
something new about the places you visit are some of the factors that make
hiking an excellent way to awaken positive emotions in you.

It's also important to note that walking can increase the hippocampus by 2%,
something that will ultimately benefit your memory.

### **3 - Lose/control your weight**

The effort expended while[walking](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/) will
help you lose or control your weight. Just to give you an idea of its impact,
walking for 30 minutes at a brisk pace will cause you to lose around 150 kcal.

If you go for longer, regular walks, you could lose up to 400 kcal per hour and
around 2.5 cm of abdominal circumference per month.

### **4 - Strengthen your immune system**

According to some scientific studies on the subject, walking regularly will help
strengthen your immune system and thus prevent colds and flu.

### **5 - Better sleep**

Regular walking will help you sleep better and maintain healthier sleep
routines.

This is because exercise stimulates the production of melatonin, a hormone
produced by the pineal gland whose function is to regulate the circadian cycle
and promote the proper functioning of the body. As icing on the cake, melatonin
also acts as an antioxidant, resulting in slower ageing.

### **6 - Reducing the risk of developing diabetes**

According to the Associação Protectora dos Diabéticos de Portugal, “physical
activity stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin and leads to the use of
glucose by the muscles, preventing it from accumulating and increasing in the
blood”.

So, to significantly reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, all you
need to do is walk for 30 minutes a day. If you already suffer from this
disease, walking will help you control it.

### **7 - Strengthen your muscular capacity**

When you walk, your muscles will end up taking in more oxygen, which will help
increase their efficiency and, consequently, make them more resilient.

What's more, since walking is part of the aerobic exercise group, you'll be able
to work and strengthen a large number of muscles.

### **8 - Fight osteoporosis**

By promoting an increase in bone density, walking is an excellent antidote to
osteoporosis, particularly for women going through the menopause, when bone
density decreases, as it will help reduce the risk of disabling injuries and
fractures.
