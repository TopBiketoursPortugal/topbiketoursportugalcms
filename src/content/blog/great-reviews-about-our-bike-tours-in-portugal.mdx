## Great Reviews about our bike tours in Portugal - Thanks Bob for it and the photo

### Bike Tour from the city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela

![Bob review about his cycling holiday](/src/assets/images/bob-review.png "Bobs' Review of our Bike Tour - Top Bike Tours")

My wife and I have now experienced seven European bike tours in various
countries. Six were guided as was this one. This tour is a notch above all the
others. You are in the constant hands and service of Sergio and his carefully
chosen guides. The biking can be challenging at times. We chose the basic
package with the meal plan. The accommodation and meals were excellent. If you
invest and trust in Sergio, you will be richly rewarded. He is truly one of a
kind. If you are as lucky as we were to be matched with kind and generous fellow
travellers, you too may also come away with one or more life long friends.
