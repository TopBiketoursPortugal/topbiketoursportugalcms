## How Fold n Visit Born and History

How Fold n Visit was born and evolved:

It all started when Sergio bought a folding bike to take him to work. Eventually
some of his friends challenged him to go on a bike trip from Porto to Santiago
de Compostela.

He eagerly accepted, and after what turned out to be a great adventure, Sergio
started a blog:

[https://dahonrips.wordpress.com/category/expeditions/santiago-de-compostela/](https://dahontrips.wordpress.com/category/expeditions/santiago-de-compostela/)

Following the blog Sergio came up with the idea of establishing a store in Porto
selling folding bikes, bike rental, and bike tours of the city center.

There were some growing pains, and the sale of folding bikes is no longer part
of the business.

We are now exclusively dedicated to what we enjoy and do best, bike tours and
rentals.

We hope you now have a better understanding of the unique origin of the company
name, and why we have kept it as a reminder of how it all began.
