The important rivers in Portugal are **Mondego**, **Douro** ,**Minho** and
**Tejo**. The Mondego begins in Serra da Estrela where is the highest mountain

farms and vineyards. North is cooler that the south and also have more rain.

that follows the banks Minho and Lima river.

In the South of Portugal, after **Lisbon** and the Tejo River, is the **southern
of Portugal** also known as the **Alentejo**. Here the climate is drier and
warmer than the North, and the landscape is dominated by plains and smooth
hills. The Alentejo Coastline is a very wild region with stunning beaches and
striking untouched nature.

More to the south is the **Algarve** region that is very popular because it is a
tourist destination. This region is very dry and sunny and you can find here
