    Santiago de Compostela Walking Tour,a unique experience for pilgrims and
    travelers
---
Not all paths of faith are inscrutable, and the Way of Saint James is the ultimate example of this.

Every year, thousands of pilgrims and travelers, eager to put themselves to the test, walk the 7 official routes that connect various points of the Iberian Peninsula and France to the magnificent Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela: the French Way, the Northern Way, the Maritime River Route, the Vía de la Plata, the English Way, the Primitive Way and the Portuguese Way.

It's true to say that all these routes lead to Compostela, but it's impossible to put into words the unique experience of setting foot on the road and, after crossing valleys, mountains, rivers and cities with blood, sweat and tears, raising your head and seeing the image of Santiago welcoming you with open arms at the front of Santiago Cathedral.

## **Discover the charms of Santiago de Compostela on foot**

It is said that the hardest part is taking the first step, but anyone who sets foot on the Camino de Santiago knows that the journey can be painful and will require a great deal of physical and mental overcoming.

However, along the way, almost like oases that urge us on, natural and human landscapes of rare charm appear on the horizon.

Depending on the route you choose, along the way to Compostela you'll be able to admire the majestic peaks and forests of the Pyrenees, Geres and Asturias, and appreciate the wonders of the Gothic style present, for example, in the Cathedral of Santa María de León, the Casa de Botines and the Cathedral of the Episcopal Palace of Astorga (the latter two by Gaudí).

Step into the Middle Ages through picturesque Basque and Asturian villages, be amazed by the fabulous and well-preserved Late Roman temple of Santalla de Bóveda in Lugo or lose yourself in love in the enchanted forests of Galicia.

In addition to these places, we must highlight the beautiful and fresh Pilgrim's Forest in Melide, near Compostela, and the panoramic views offered by Alto de San Roque (in Liñares), O Cebreiro and Monte do Gozo, a hill where you'll soothe your soul with a glimpse of Santiago Cathedral in the background.

There's no shortage of reasons to fall in love with your trip or pilgrimage on foot.

&nbsp;

A passion that is not only offered to us by the magnificent landscapes and monuments that appear along the way, but also by the culture, traditions and, above all, the charming people who, with a smile on their faces, will always be ready to help our spirits with a word of encouragement and comfort our bodies with a blanket and the best of Iberian cuisine.

## **The French Way: a pilgrimage journey**

A World Heritage Site, the first European Cultural Route and the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord among Peoples, the French road to Santiago de Compostela is undoubtedly the best known and most used route by pilgrims and travelers.

When the tomb of the Apostle St. James was discovered in the 9th century, hundreds of pilgrims from central and northern Europe began to flock to the site, but it was from then on that the route was described in detail (starting points, stages, hostels, etc.).

In the Codex Calixtinus (the Calixtine Codex), a 12th century publication, the French Way to Compostela gained global prominence and, in the 21st century, is traveled by more than 200,000 people every year.

Despite the immense difficulties it offers pilgrims, particularly crossing the Pyrenees and the peaks of the Basque Country and Asturias, there is something magical/divine about this route that gives it a mystique all of its own.

Not unrelated to this aura is the wealth of architecture, art and landscape that patiently awaits the pilgrims' dazzled gaze at every turn. Among this remarkable gallery of magnificence and beauty, the following stand out:

* The Gateway to the Pyrenees;
* Navarre's bridges, including the Bandidos Bridge, the Irotz Bridge and the Ultzama Bridge;
* Muruzábal Palace (Puente de la Reina);
* Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Estella);
* Monasteries of Suso and Yuso de San Millán de la Cogolla, both World Heritage Sites;
* Castillo de Belorado, O Cid's famous castle;
* Basilica of San Izidoro, León, an ex-libris of Romanesque architecture and the burial place of the kings of León;
* Cathedral of the Episcopal Palace of Astorga:
* Vineyards and a medieval bridge over the river Cua (Cacabelos);
* Tríacastela, flanked by beautiful mountains and lush forests, is a stopping point for pilgrims, as it is here that they traditionally exchange experiences about the journey;
* Atapuerca, Europe's main palaeontological site;
* Cruz de Ferro, the highest point on the Way (1,500 meters above sea level) where tradition dictates that pilgrims stand with their backs to the cross and throw a stone at it as an offering;
* Templar Castle of Ponferrada;
* Peregrino Forest (and octopus, a local specialty) in Melide, Galicia.

## **Santiago de Compostela Walking Tours: Immersion in the city's history and culture**

With more or less difficulty, regardless of the route chosen, the goal is always the same: to reach the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.

To do this, there are two options that literally jump out at you: organize the trip or choose the walking tour that [Top Walking Tours](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/) has for you.

Starting in Porto, Top Walking Tours takes pilgrims along the old and beautiful Portuguese Way, which runs in two stages (1st to the border of Valença do Minho and 2nd from Porrinõ to Santiago de Compostela).

After landscapes of unimaginable greenery and with your stomach well comforted by the delicacies you can taste along the way, you will finally arrive in Compostela.

Here, after the obligatory visit to the Cathedral, it's time to take a look at some of the possible walking routes that Top Walking Tours offers through its various guided tours in Santiago de Compostela.

Founded in the 9th century due to the discovery of the remains of the apostle St. James Zebedee in the area, Compostela naturally developed around pilgrimages in the first centuries of its life.

In the 16th century, the sacred was mixed with the profane with the creation of the University, one of the oldest in Europe and an obligatory stop on a visit to the city.

Marked by the Baroque, Compostela entered contemporary times as a bastion of the "Galician" identity that eventually earned it the title of political capital of Galicia in 1981.

As is the case in many cities in the north of Portugal and Galicia, the ancient merges with the contemporary. An example of this is the Historic Center (a World Heritage Site) where, alongside the rich heritage of churches, monasteries and palaces, there are picturesque stores, bars, restaurants and the heart of the city: Praza do Obradoiro.

In this monumental square, pilgrims, travelers, tourists, locals and authorities gather every day in a perfect synthesis of the city's ancient history and customs, setting the tone for the Compostela of today.

As well as the imposing Cathedral, this square is home to the Pazo de Xelmírez (an integral part of the Cathedral), the Parador de Santiago - Hostal Reis Catolicos (a former hospital for pilgrims and locals, and now a 5-star hotel), the Palacio de Raxoi (the seat of Santiago City Council) and a sculpture alluding to the legend of Santiago.

Although Compostela is rich in squares full of history, such as Praza das Praterías (a former goldsmiths' center) and Praza da Quintana (the site of the Quintana dos Mortos, a former cemetery, and the Quintana dos Vivos, a square where concerts and street shows are currently held), it is much more than that.

&nbsp;

The proof of this is Rua do Franco, where, among pilgrims looking for the Cathedral, we can find, delight ourselves and cry for more with the best of Compostela's gastronomy: Galician empanadas, Galician octopus, Lacón with grelos or the comforting Galician broth.

If you want to digest the feast of typical Galician dishes, you can stay on this street, which offers a vibrant selection of bars for a good night out, or alternatively head to Ensanche (Praza da Galicia), where the people of Compostela gather for a night of drinking and dancing.

In terms of cultural offerings, we can't miss Rua Nova either, which, with its 800 years of history, is home to the city's two main theaters.

To take a break from so much immersion, head to Parque da Alameda, the city's most beautiful green space and the best place for a relaxing stroll with views of the Cathedral of Santiago and Compostela.

Speaking of the Cathedral...

## **Santiago Cathedral: an icon of faith and architecture**

When, after a long walk through hills and valleys, you arrive at Praza do Obradoiro, your eyes tear up, your legs weaken and your soul opens to the splendor of the magnificent Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.

Born in the 9th century as a small chapel to commemorate the discovery of the alleged remains of the apostle Santiago Maior, it was only after the Christian reconquest of Galicia that it acquired its current form.

Built in 1075 by King Alfonso VI, under the patronage of Bishop Diego Páez, the Cathedral of Santiago took almost a century to complete, as the work was carried out in three different stages.

Although completed, it was not until April 1211 that it was consecrated by Archbishop Pedro Muñiz in the presence of King Alfonso IX of León.

***Fun fact:** the various stages of the cathedral's construction can be seen in the motifs carved on the capitals of the central nave.*

*While on the first ones (starting from the transept), you can see pairs of fantastic and real animals (eagles, lions, doves and mermaids), on the last four sections, the flat or spiral leaves with motifs of men among beasts (lions, dragons and wolves), signed by the workshop of Master Mateus, responsible for the third and final phase of the work, stand out.*

The majesty of its exterior can only be matched by its interior, where visitors will be delighted by the statuary and details of the Pórtico da Glória, the Botafumeiro (a silver-plated brass censer that weighs 62 kg empty and measures 1.60 m in height), the figure of Santiago Mata-Mouros in the center of the chancel and, of course, the silver urn where the relics of Santiago are deposited.

As we mentioned earlier, with the publication in the Codex Calixtinus of the Way, the pilgrimages began that would make this cathedral, with its distinctly Romanesque style, the center of Christian life on the Peninsula.

Over the centuries, the Cathedral has undergone various changes to its structure, including the demolition of the decrepit old medieval façade (1738) and the construction, in its place, of the current Baroque façade where we can see, among the Romanesque towers with Baroque trimmings, the unmistakable image of Santiago the pilgrim, with his hat, cloak and staff.

Despite the alterations, not only has its aura not been damaged, but it has grown enough to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.

## **What to pack in your backpack: essential equipment for pilgrims**

The pilgrimage is long and hard, but if you carry the right equipment in your pilgrim's backpack, everything will be easier.

So, in addition to the CC, credit/debit card, an identification document, Pilgrim's Credential and the iconic scallop shell hanging from your backpack (it identifies you as a Santiago pilgrim), you should also carry your backpack:

* Lightweight, breathable clothing, including two convertible pants, one pair of lycra shorts, three T-shirts (two long-sleeved and one T-shirt), a waterproof windbreaker, a fleece jacket, synthetic fiber underwear without seams or elastic, a bath towel, a pair of sandals, a hat, 3 to 5 pairs of bubble socks;
* A pair of used hiking boots;
* Sleeping bag;
* Swiss Army knife;
* Flashlight;
* Refillable water bottle;
* Energy bars and fruit;
* Cell phone and charger;
* A triple plug;
* Sunscreen, sunglasses and lipstick;
* Lighter and a roll of toilet paper;
* Garbage bag;
* Toothbrush, toothpaste and shampoo bottle (small);
* First-aid kit and medicines, including compeed for blisters, medical tape, betadine, absorbent cotton, Band-Aids, an elastic bandage, sterile compresses, gel for muscle pain, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and Vaseline.
