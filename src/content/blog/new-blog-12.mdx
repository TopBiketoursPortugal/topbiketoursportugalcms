are designed for all ages and fitness levels, complete with stays in truly
enchanting locations. Gather the family and explore adventure-filled trails
waiting just for you.

2. **Picnics**
   There’s nothing like enjoying good weather with a picnic
   alongside family and friends in one of Portugal’s many natural parks. Just
   remember: leave the place as you found it—or, better yet, even cleaner.
3. **Cycling**
   Nothing brings kids and adults together quite like a bike
   ride—heroic or not! While pro cyclists battle it out in the Tour de France or
   Spain’s Vuelta, why not take advantage of long summer days to pedal your way
   through Portugal’s hidden gems, unreachable by car?
   Three tips: choose
   routes suited to your fitness level, pick bikes appropriate for the terrain,
   and stay hydrated.
4. **Yoga**
   While hiking and cycling keep your body healthy, don’t forget
   your mind—try practicing yoga, ideally in a calm, pleasant spot surrounded by
   nature. Beyond relaxation, yoga improves breathing and boosts muscle
   flexibility, which will come in handy on your hikes.
5. **Nature Photography**
   If you’ve got an eye for photography, capturing
   nature is a perfect summer activity. Not only will you snap moments of rare
   beauty, but you’ll also get to explore some of Portugal’s most captivating
   natural landscapes.
6. **Canyoning**
   When the heat kicks in, nothing beats being in the water.
   Add a taste of adventure, and you’ve got canyoning—a sport that involves
   progressively exploring rivers. Due to its difficulty and risks, we recommend
   not doing it alone.
7. **Climbing**
   Rounding off our list of thrilling sports is a major
   physical and mental challenge: climbing. If it’s your first time, seek out a
   climbing school and join their activities before going solo. Though the gear
   can be pricey, natural climbing walls are completely free and promise
   unforgettable moments of adventure.
