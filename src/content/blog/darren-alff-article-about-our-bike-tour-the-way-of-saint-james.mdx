"The Camino de Santiago is known in English as the Way of Saint James and is a
network of hiking and biking paths leading to the shrine of the apostle Saint
James the Great in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern
Spain, where tradition has it that the remains of the saint are buried.

People from all around the world travel to Portugal and Spain in order to hike
or bike one or more of the various routes to Santiago de Compostela as a form of
religious pilgrimage or spiritual retreat. Others, however, chose to travel the
Way of St. James purely for entertainment, sightseeing and enjoyment purposes.

While it’s possible to cycle the Way of St. James on your own, many pilgrims opt
to participate in guided or self-guided cycling tours, as this mode of travel
offers one of the easiest and most enjoyable methods for successfully reaching
the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela.

For those wishing to cycle the Camino, one of the best ways to do it is to start
in the city of Porto, Portugal and then cycle from there, to the north, along
the coast, approximately 278 kilometers (173 miles) to the city of Santiago de
Compostela in northwestern Spain. Then, after reaching the cathedral in Santiago
de Compostela and completing the pilgrimage, simply travel back to Porto,
Portugal and return home from there.

This epic European adventure can be completed in a single week… and one of the
best ways to participate this memorable cycling holiday is to take part in a
guided or self-guided cycling tour with Fold N’ Visit Cycling Holidays – a small
tour company based out of Porto, Portugal that specializes in this leading
customers from all around the world along this particular route in northern
Portugal and Spain."
