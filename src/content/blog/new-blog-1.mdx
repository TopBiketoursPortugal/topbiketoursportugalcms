# **Tours of the Douro Valley: where wine culture meets natural beauty**

<SnippetsAstroImage image_path="/src/assets/images/tours-of-the-douro-valley-where-wine-culture-meets-natural-beauty.jpg" image_alt="Tours of the Douro Valley: where wine culture meets natural beauty"/>

For the Douro's Miguel Torga, the Douro Valley "is not a panorama that the eyes
contemplate: it is an excess of nature". The phrase, like the nature it
describes, is beautiful, but we would add that it is also an "excess of
humanity".

The landscape, and the astonishment it contains when it opens up before the eyes
of the thousands of people who visit the Douro Valley, would not be the same
without the strength and ingenuity of thousands of anonymous arms that, over the
centuries, have shaped the warm Douro soil into the cradle of one of the most
iconic and delicious nectars of the Gods ever produced under the sun.

It is in the synthesis of this unique union between Nature and Man that a place
full of history and stories, mysteries and, above all, a beauty that makes you
want to return to again and again, and which holds high the title of World
Heritage Site.

If you're interested in exploring this stunning landscape, consider doing so
through
[Portugal Walking Tours](https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/hiking-tours-portugal/),
which offer a unique way to immerse yourself in the charm of the Douro Valley.

&nbsp;

## **The Douro Valley's rich history: from villages to vineyards**

Although the first vineyards in the Douro date back to the Roman occupation, it
wasn't until the signing of the Treaty of Windsor between Portugal and England
(the oldest treaty between nations still in force today) that the wine culture
gained momentum in the region with the first estates controlled by wealthy
English wine merchants.

This first wave of English wine merchants gave birth to some of the most iconic
names in Port, such as Taylor's, but if there are any names that deserve an
honorable mention in the entire history of the Douro Valley, it's Dona Antónia
Adelaide Ferreira, better known as Ferreirinha, and Marquês do Pombal.

A symbol of female entrepreneurship and Douro viticulture, Ferreirinha, as she
was affectionately known among her workers, is still today an example of courage
and selflessness among the people of the Douro.

As well as managing her more than half a hundred quintas (Quinta do Vale Meão,
Quinta das Nogueiras, Quinta do Vesúvio, etc.) with an iron fist and investing
in new techniques for growing and bottling Port wine, the "Queen of the Douro"
was also at the forefront of the fight against the plague of phylloxera that
struck the vineyards in the 19th century and against the poverty that raged in
the region.

As well as Taylor's, Symington's and Ferreirinha, to talk about the Douro wine
region is to talk about the Marquis of Pombal. It was up to this important
figure in Portuguese history to transform the Douro into the world's first
demarcated wine region (1756) by placing 300 stone posts known as the "Pombaline
milestones".

**\*Fun fact:** did you know that the history of the Ferreirinha family is
intertwined with that of the Marquis of Pombal?\*

_It's true. Under sentence of imprisonment, Bernardo Ferreira, Dona Antónia's
grandfather, was forced by the Marquis to cultivate some deserted land called
Montes de Rodo. Over time, these "hills" became beautiful wine-producing
estates._

However, there is no list long enough to contain all the millions of anonymous
people who, in the vineyards or at the helm of the iconic Rabelo boats, planted,
harvested and delivered to the Port wine cellars in Gaia, the wine that has made
and continues to delight Port lovers.

It was also up to all these people to give shape to six typical wine-growing
villages that helped shape the landscape of the Douro wine region: Barcos,
Favaios, Provesende, Salzedas, Trevões and Ucanha.

Visitors are guaranteed unique and unforgettable experiences through their
heritage, gastronomy and natural surroundings.

Also unforgettable is the trip on the Douro line train.

At its usual rhythmic pace on the rails, the train takes us through some of the
valley's most beautiful natural landscapes to the stations of Pinhão, a place
embellished with ancient tiles alluding to wine culture, Pocinho and Barca de
Alva, the latter marking the entrance to the high cliffs of the Douro
International Natural Park.

However, no Douro Valley tour would be complete without a visit to the Douro
Museum, Peso da Régua, which gives us another perspective on wine culture and
the region, the Sanctuary of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios in Lamego, Numão Castle
and, of course, the Foz Coa Archaeological Park, an open-air rock art gallery
classified as a World Heritage Site.

## **Traditional cuisine and handicrafts: a taste of Douro culture**

The saying goes that "those who don't eat, don't work" and in the Douro, where
the work is hard and long, this couldn't be truer.

Wine, olive oil, chestnuts, almonds, figs, smoked meats, river fish, kid, lamb
and even octopus are the main ingredients in a cuisine where culinary treats
such as:

\- Roast kid or lamb with rice from the oven and "papas milhas" with boiled pork
liver from Cinfães;

\- Grilled octopus and pears in muscatel wine from Alijó;

\- Falachas and piled chestnuts from Mesão Frio;

\- Meatballs from Lamego;

\- Hare rice with cabbage from Freixo de Espada à Cinta;

And whether you're coming or going, you can't miss the famous francesinha from
Porto to round off this gastronomic journey through the Douro Valley.

If all these dishes are food for the body, handicrafts are undoubtedly food for
the mind.

While the generous food is being prepared, enjoy the rich costumes of Miranda do
Douro's pauliteiros in saragoza, burel and linen, Lamego's chestnut basketry,
bagpipes, embroidery and linen lace, Alijó's black clay púcaras or Freixo de
Espada à Cinta's silk weaving.

## **Festivals and events in the Douro Valley: celebrating local traditions**

Visiting the Douro Valley is also about taking part in the many events that
punctuate the region and celebrating local traditions.

Mark your calendar:

\- Essência do Vinho: between February 22 and 25, 2024, the Palácio da Bolsa in
Porto will once again host this event dedicated to wine, which brings together
the main protagonists of wine culture in Portugal and gives visitors the
opportunity to learn more about the nectar of the Gods and taste some of the
best Douro wines.

\- Douro Wine City: although recent, this event in Peso da Régua is attracting
more and more visitors eager to learn more about the Douro's wine culture and
traditions, as well as take part in wine tastings and regional Douro products,
showcookings and tastings.

\- Festa em Honra de Nossa Senhora do Socorro: although it lasts the whole month
of August, it is on the weekend of August 15 that Peso da Régua's star festival
reaches its zenith.

On this day, thousands of people gather on the waterfront for a night of dancing
and drinking that culminates in the famous Arraial do Rio, set against the
backdrop of the River Douro and the terraces that surround the city.

\- Harvest Festival: to mark the start of the grape harvest (September), various
estates and municipalities in the Douro Valley celebrate the moment with
festivals featuring local delicacies, music and, of course, wine.

In addition to this, many of these estates also allow visitors to have a
complete harvest experience (picking and treading the grapes) and enjoy wine
tastings and wine dinners.

\- Feast in Honor of Our Lady of Remedies: between August 24 and September 9,
thousands of pilgrims and revelers flock to Lamego to thank Our Lady of Remedies
for the answer to their prayers and to celebrate with good Douro wine and
meatballs.

## **Cycling the Douro Valley: trails and routes**
