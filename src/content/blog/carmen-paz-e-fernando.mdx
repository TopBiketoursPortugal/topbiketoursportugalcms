## Carmen and Fernando made the Way to Santiago by the Coast in October 2017.

As we explained to all our customers, our way in the first 3 days touches 70%
the original route of the coast. We've changed the original coast path so it's
easy for most people.

However, this couple from Brazil took the liberty of following the
[Camino to Santiago the coast path](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/porto-santiago-compostela-bike-tour/)by
following the arrows and pedaling through more complicated rails, making this
adventure even more unforgettable.

Thanks for the photos Carmen and Fernando
