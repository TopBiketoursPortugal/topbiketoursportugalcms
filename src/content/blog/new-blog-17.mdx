With a rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and a vibrant culture, Portugal
stands today as one of Europe’s most exciting destinations. Blending the charm
of the old world with modern sophistication, this seaside paradise proudly
showcases its cities. In this
<a href="https://topwalkingtoursportugal.com/pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Top<br />Walking Tours</em> guide</a>, discover seven of Portugal’s most captivating
cities.

#### Lisbon

Lisbon, the capital, is the perfect starting point for a list brimming with
enchanting options. Known for its sunny days, Lisbon masterfully balances
deep-rooted tradition with cutting-edge influences flowing in from around the
globe.

Nicknamed the “city of seven hills,” its unique topography of highs and lows
invites you to explore winding streets paved with mesmerizing patterned tiles.
With a historical landmark around every corner, you might only notice time
passing as the sun begins to set. From the UNESCO-listed Belém Tower to the
Jerónimos Monastery—a pinnacle of Portugal’s golden Age of Discovery—to the
colorful tiles of Alfama and the bold sophistication of MAAT (Museum of Art,
Architecture, and Technology), the choice is yours.

#### Porto

Nestled along the Douro River to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the west,
Porto is Portugal’s second-largest city—and no less significant for it. Known as
the “unconquered city,” Porto stands as a proud bastion of tradition, proving
time and again to visitors why it’s the right choice.

Its UNESCO-listed historic center immediately marks Porto as a refined
destination for those who love the stories walls can tell. Speaking of
history-laden walls, why not start your visit at the Ribeira district? With its
stunning colorful facades and riverside strolls, it’s hard to imagine a more
relaxing beginning. Don’t miss crossing the Dom Luís I Bridge to Vila Nova de
Gaia, home to the world-famous Port wine cellars—a must for wine enthusiasts. If
books are more your thing, head back across the river to the Livraria Lello,
with its breathtaking spiral staircase. Porto has something for everyone.

#### Viana do Castelo

Located on Portugal’s northern coast, Viana do Castelo remains a lesser-known
tourist spot, yet it’s one of the best for those seeking a mix of history,
natural beauty, and seaside relaxation.

With a rich naval heritage—first during the Age of Discovery and later
supporting cod fishing in the last century—its connection to the sea shines
through. Visit the Gil Eannes hospital ship museum, built in 1955 to serve
Portugal’s cod fleet in the Nordic seas. If you prefer history on solid ground,
the Santa Luzia Basilica, perched atop a hill, offers panoramic views of the
Atlantic and pristine beaches below, all yours to enjoy.

#### Coimbra

Famed at home and abroad for its academic legacy—its 13th-century university, a
UNESCO World Heritage site, is one of Europe’s oldest—Coimbra is also one of
Portugal’s most historic cities.

Nestled along the Mondego River, it greets visitors with streets echoing a
distant medieval past, perfect for long walks. For a taste of its culture and
tradition, a stop at the Old Cathedral (Sé Velha) is a must, where caped
students occasionally serenade with Coimbra’s unique style of Fado.

#### Évora

Located in the Alentejo region and a UNESCO World Heritage site, Évora is one of
Portugal’s most fascinating historic cities, especially for those craving
culture and laid-back charm.

Wander its medieval streets to find the well-preserved Roman Temple of Diana or
the striking (and slightly eerie) Chapel of Bones. Alternatively, simply indulge
in Alentejo’s cuisine and wines, all wrapped in the serene allure of the
countryside.

#### Sintra

A short trip from Lisbon, Sintra feels like a fairy tale brought to life.
Shrouded in mysticism and often cloaked in fog due to its microclimate, Sintra
welcomes visitors with the iconic Pena Palace, perched high on a hill with a
vibrant palette that sets the tone for what’s to come.

Explore the Quinta da Regaleira, with its enigmatic Initiatic Well, or the
Moorish Castle, offering jaw-dropping panoramic views. If hiking is more your
speed, the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park boasts scenic trails and abundant
wildlife. Before leaving, savor the local pastries—a delicious farewell.

#### Faro

Faro, the capital of the Algarve, conjures images of a classic coastal paradise.
But this final suggestion isn’t just about crystal-clear beaches and fresh
seafood—though both are fantastic and worth the trip alone. Faro also carries
deep historical weight, with medieval architectural gems like the Arco da Vila
and Igreja do Carmo in its old town. Whether you’re a nature lover or a history
buff, Faro is a destination to consider.
