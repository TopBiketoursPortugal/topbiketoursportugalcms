You donÂ´t use to walk and you havenÂ´t think about the idea of a hiking tour
experience? Maybe you have the wrong idea that this is for avid walkers that
hike all day, wearing lycra and sweatingâ€¦.but hiking tours arenÂ´t like that
(note: some are). You should consider do a walking trip and there are some
reasons for that:

- A walk will help you sleep better when you get back to your bed and with this
  adventure experience you can develop a positive addiction ðŸ˜Š, make new friends
  and have a happy week! In a hiking tour it is possible to visit a place free
  from stressful traffic and driving. That is possible because our guides know
  the area so you will benefit from their experience. No rush, no schedules to
  arrange. Your luggage will be collected every day, your accommodations are
  booked. Just wake up in the morning, have breakfast, and enjoy the day!
