    description:
      "The path departs from Baiona towards Vigo. This walk feels as a densely
      urbanized area, with the ever present constructions and landscape
      alteration visible along the way. A big portion of the walk is made along
      side an asphalted road, inside a protective shoulder, which is used by
      both cyclists and pedestrians. Some of the areas that might spark your
      interest during the day are: Senda dos Lagares near Vigo, beautiful place
      near the river where the path passes by, the monument to Elduayen, the
      monument to Jules Verne, the hill fort of Vigo, the Stone Market and the
      Co-Cathedral of Santa María."

      The flat days are now left behind and the path starts to deviate from the
            coastal side. This walk is quite more hilly than any of the other ones so
            far. The first few kilometers are still made inside the busy and always
            shifting Vigo area. A constant degree of elevation is noticeable
            throughout the majority of the first half of this walk while climbing
            Penide hill, until the highest point of this walk is reached, at 430
            meters. After that a quick downhill follows. The final quarter of this
            walk is inside a valley. A good portion of this walk is paved, although
            there are plenty natural areas at the higher elevations. Some of the areas
            that might spark your interest during the day are: The oyster nursery
            areas near Vigo at the ocean entrance, the zoo of Vigo called Vigozoo and
            Mámoa do rei, a neolithic tumulus in the Penide hill.

      The hills are here to stay and as such this walk is not an exception. With
            a cumulative total of 670m of uphill and downhill, a lot of the walk is
            through dirt or secondary paths. Encountering the main road is still
            expected, since the different paths divert from the main road and go
            through low to no traffic areas. There are two main hills between 160 and
            140m to cover during this walk. Some of the areas that might spark your
            interest during the day are: Ponte de San Paio, romantic bridge from the
            XIII century, church of Santa María de Ponte Sampaio. While in Pontevedra
            there is a whole repertoire of places to visit, serves as an example the
            monument to the heroes of the Sampaio bridge in Pontevedra, the convent of
            Saint Francis of Pontevedra, the chapel of the pilgrim virgin and the
            Spain plaza.

    description: |-
      From this day forward it is noticeable a clear change on the type of back roads that are taken to get to Santiago. There is a feeling of being cared for and having roads practically for pilgrims use. There is plentiful amount of dirt paths, mixed with paved secondary streets and the occasional visit to the main road. There are two main uphill areas, being the biggest right at the end of this walk in order to get to the hotel.

      Some of the areas that might spark your interest during the day are: The church of San Cristobal De Briallos, the thermal fountain of las Burgas in Caldas de Rei, the church of San Tomé Becket, the carballeira of Caldas de Reis, a small garden in the town, and the paths that follow along the river, those of which you will cross while getting to the hotel.
